    > The featured image will be used across the website as "header image", if no featured image is provided, the image set in Customizer will be displayed.

- Widget Areas

    Available widget positions
        > Sidebar Right
        Footer Area
            > Footer A ( Column )
            > Footer B ( Column )
            > Footer C ( Column )
            > Footer D ( Column )

        Note that the footer columns will resize depending on the widgets used. For example, if you use Footer A, and Footer B columns, the footer will be split in 2 equal parts (columns will always have the exact size)

- Featured images are used as header images on pages where they are appointed. This is used in order to keep the overall design style of the template. If no feature image is configured, the image set in customizer will be used (Featured image has a higher priority).
